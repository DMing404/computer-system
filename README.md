# Advanced Computer System & Architecture
This course focuses on advanced topics in the design and analysis of computer architectures. Topics covered include instruction set design, pipelining, instruction- level parallelism, high-speed memory systems, storage systems, interconnection networks, and multiprocessor architectures. Students will have an opportunity to perform research in these and other areas in the field of computer architecture. An undergraduate course in computer architecture (or equivalent) is the prerequisite.
